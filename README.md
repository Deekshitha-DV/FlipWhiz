## About The Project

FlipWhiz is my **first solo project**, and it‚Äôs currently **40% completed**. I took up this challenge to build a dynamic and visually appealing eBook reading platform using just **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** so far. The idea is to provide users with a modern, book-like feel through flipping animations and a clean, smooth interface.

### Motivation

I love reading and visual storytelling. I wanted to create something **useful, beautiful, and fun** that blends the old-school feeling of flipping pages with today‚Äôs digital interface. This project is not only a practical learning journey for me but also a creative outlet.

### What I Learned

* Setting up and organizing a project structure
* Designing interactive elements with CSS & JavaScript
* Working with responsive layouts
* Handling local development with GitHub and VS Code

### What Makes FlipWhiz Stand Out

* Unique flip-style animations
* Custom UI elements
* Built from scratch without templates
* A personal project with passion, design, and self-learning behind every feature

## Key Features

* Flipbook-style page animations
* Clean and responsive UI
* Book categories and titles (in progress)

* Light/Dark mode (planned)
* Feedback and user rating (future enhancement)
