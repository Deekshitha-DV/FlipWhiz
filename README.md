> üìö A fun, quirky eBook platform where digital reading meets creativity and user-friendly design.

---

## About The Project

**FlipWhiz** is a solo-built, lighthearted digital reading platform in progress ‚Äî designed to change the way we browse, explore, and engage with eBooks. This is my first-ever project that I‚Äôm building completely by myself, and it's currently 20% complete.

### Motivation

* I‚Äôve always been passionate about making learning and reading more fun.
* I wanted to build something practical, creative, and user-focused.
* This project is a milestone in my self-learning journey as a developer.

### What Makes It Special?

* Unique, fun UI approach ‚Äî not your usual book platform.
* Completely self-initiated and self-built (learning by doing!).
* Clean and expandable structure for scaling features later.

---

## Key Features (Planned)

* üìñ Browse a wide collection of eBooks.
* üîç Search books with filters and categories.
* ‚ù§Ô∏è Bookmark or save your favorite reads.
* üß† Personalized suggestions (coming soon).
* üé® Smooth transitions and fun micro-interactions.

## Built With

*(As of now, basic stack. Will expand later.)*

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (Vanilla)

> Future Stack Goals: React.js + Firebase/MongoDB for backend + animations using GSAP/Framer Motion
